**ðŸ”¹ Steps to Follow (Charts in Excel)**

1. Open your dataset from Task 1 (sales, student grades, or any sample data).

2. Select the relevant data range (rows and columns).

3. Go to the Insert tab in Excel.

4. From the Charts section, choose different chart types.

5. Insert the chart â†’ Customize with titles, labels, legends, and colors.

6. Repeat for each required chart (Bar, Line, Pie, etc.).

7. Add brief analysis under each chart (what it represents).

8. Save the workbook and record your video demonstration.

**ðŸ”¹ Description of Charts You Used**


**1. Bar Chart**

**Use:** Compare values across categories (e.g., sales per product, marks per student).

**Why:** Easy for visual comparison of quantities.

**2. 2D Line Chart & 3D Area Chart**


**Line Chart:** Shows trends over time (e.g., monthly sales growth).

**3D Area Chart:** Similar to a line chart but emphasizes the magnitude of values (area filled under the line).

**Why:** Useful for tracking progress and changes.

**3. Pie Chart**

**Use:** Shows percentage share of each category in the whole (e.g., market share, subject marks distribution).

**Why:** Best for proportions, but not for too many categories.

**4. Tree Map**


**Use:** Displays hierarchical data with nested rectangles (e.g., sales by region â†’ then by product).

**Why:** Good for showing proportions within categories.

**5. Histogram**


**Use:** Shows frequency distribution (e.g., how many students fall in certain grade ranges).

**Why:** Perfect for analyzing distributions and patterns.


**6. Funnel Chart**

**Use:** Visualizes data that flows through stages (e.g., sales process: leads â†’ opportunities â†’ conversions).

**Why:** Helps identify bottlenecks in a process.

**7. Scatter Chart**


**Use:** Plots two variables against each other (e.g., study hours vs. exam score).

**Why:** Shows relationships, correlations, or outliers.

**8. Pareto Chart**


**Use:** Combination of bars + line showing values in descending order with a cumulative percentage line.

**Why:** Helps apply the 80/20 rule (identify the few categories causing the biggest impact).
